text = "Admittedly, as in South Korea, the first liability when you send a nude image is always the person to whom it is addressed. Snapchat or Instagram allow you to send photos that \"self-destruct\" once seen and detect if the recipient takes a screenshot, but unfortunately there are apps that allow you to save an ephemeral photo without informing the sender.\n\nBut even if you have absolute trust in your partner, that doesn't mean your nudes will be 100% safe. In 2014, during an event known as \"fappening\", more than 500 nude photos of celebrities, mainly actresses or singers, were published on the forum _4chan_. Among the victims: Jennifer Lawrence, Kirsten Dunst, Ariana Grande or Emily Ratajkowski. The cause of this leak: a security flaw in Apple's iCloud service, which allowed hackers to access the photos automatically saved from the victims' iPhones.\n\nWhile this is the most well-known, it's not the only one. In 2019, a technological flaw in the gay dating app Jack'd led to a leak of several million user photos—and among them, many with explicit content.\n\nTo guard against these security risks, it is best to have sex using end-to-end encryption apps, such as WhatsApp, Signal or Telegram (with the \"secret chat\" mode). In this case, only the recipient of your nude can decode it. On Snapchat and Instagram, all the photos, including ephemeral ones, are stored in plain text on their servers.\n\nThe best way to protect yourself against leaks, whether they come from a disrespectful ex or a computer security breach, is therefore to avoid being recognizable. It is better not to show your face, and to avoid certain elements that could identify you: tattoos, birthmarks, moles, or simply the decor of the photo. For the most paranoid, it is also possible to delete the EXIF metadata of the photos, which reveal the date, time and place of the shooting, as well as the phone model."
