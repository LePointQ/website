text = "It’s an increasingly common practice, back in the spotlight in mid-February, when a sex tape of Benjamin Griveaux was leaked on the Internet, forcing the Paris mayoral candidate to drop out. According to [a 2018 Zava survey](https://www.zavamed.com/fr/etude-zava-2018-sextos-et-nudes.html), 19% of men and 15% of women in Europe have had some of their nudes \"leaked.\"\n\nAt the same time, the phenomenon is growing in college yards, high schools and on social networks. [The \"fisha\" accounts](https://www.lemonde.fr/pixels/article/2020/04/07/harcelement-sexuel-avec-le-confinement-le-retour-en-force-des-comptes-fisha-sur-les-reseaux-sociaux_6035853_4408996.html), on which teens expose nude images of other teens (mainly girls) exploded during the first lockdown. The _E-Enfance association_, which helps minors who are victims of cyber-bullying, has seen their demand doubled between March and May 2020.\n\nIf you are confronted with revenge porn, there are several things you can do:\n\n* First, **a law protects you**: in France, article 67 of the \"Digital Republic Act\" has strengthened the offense of voluntary invasion of privacy, adding an aggravating circumstance for non-consensual dissemination of sexual images (Article 226-2-1 of the Penal Code). Revenge porn is therefore punishable by two years in prison and a fine of 60,000 euros.\n* **Surround yourself** with people you trust. To talk and get legal help, you can call _Net-Écoute_ at 0800 200 000, or connect to [their digital platform](https://www.netecoute.fr/#). The association _En Avant Toutes_ [has also set up a chat](https://enavanttoutes.fr/) to guide you. If you are a victim of \"fisha\" accounts, get in touch with [@stopfisha](https://twitter.com/StopFisha), a collective against cybersexism.\n* **Gather evidence**. Take as many screenshots as possible, report the profile and block the person. You can also send a report on [the Ministry of Interior’s dedicated website](). Then, file a complaint if you wish. The police will guide you through the process (criminal and/or civil proceedings are possible).\n* Finally, if you encounter stolen nudes, report them and try accompanying the victim. If you want to share an image, keep in mind that the diffusion is a crime, and therefore you are liable to the same penalties as those stated above.\n\nThis little practical guide from the Point Q team will be there if you need it, for you or for your relatives!"
